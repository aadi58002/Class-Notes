* Probability
** Sample space
It is the set of all the possible outcomes
Eg -
*** Statement method ( physically writing all the outcomes )
1. coin toss = { H, T }
2. Dice = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
*** Point on the Circle circumeference
Circle = $$x^{2} + y^{2} = c^{2}$$
Points inside the circle = S { (x,y) | $$x^{2} + y^{2} < c^{2}$$ }
Points on boundary = S { (x,y) | $$x^{2} + y^{2} = c^{2}$$ }
** Event
It is a subset of the sample space.
Eg -
Let there be a large stock of light Bulbs. Now we select 3 bulbs at random to see if they are Defective (D) or Non Defective (N)
Sample space = { DDD, DDN , DND , NDD , DNN , NDN , NND , NNN }
Let our event be to have minimum 2 Defective items = E { DDD , DDN , DND , NDD }
*** Mutually Exculsive
Events which does not have any common elements in them are known as Mutually Exculsive events.
*** Independent Events
Events which do not affect the output of other event.
** Condition probability
A given B has already occurred.
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) (Here P(B) > 0)
** Representation
*** Venn Diagram
Diagrammatic represenataion of the relationship between the events & sample space.

** Properties
*** Additive property
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
*** Multiplication property
from the Condition probability Equation
By moving P(B) to the other side of the equation
P(A|B) \times P(B) = p(A ∩ B)
- If the events are Independent Event
** Rules

**** Discrete proability distributions
f(x) = P( X = Z )
(i) f(x) >= 0 ∀ x
(ii) Σ f(x) = 1
**** Contiuous proability distributions
$$f(x) \ge 0$$

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (f(x) \times dx) = 1$$

$$P(a<X<b)=\int_{a}^{b} (f(x) \times dx)$$

* Question
** Question 1
Find the errors in the following statements?
1. The probability is that the automobile's sales person will sell 0 1 2 or 3 cars on any given day in feb are respectively - 0.19 0.38 0.29 0.15?
   -> Error here is that the sum of the probability is greater than 1. It is 1.01.
2. The probability that it will rain is 0.40 and the probability it will not rain is 0.50 ?
   -> Not possible as the sum of complementary condition is not 1.
3. The probability is that a printer will make 0 1 2 3 4 or more mistakes in setting a document are respectively 0.19 0.34 -0.25 0.43 and 0.29?
   -> Probability can't be negative.
4. On a single draw from a deck of playing cards the probability of selecting a heart is 0.25, the probability of selecting a black card is 0.50 and the probability of selecting both heart and black card is 0.125?
   -> Here the additive rules fails as the P(Black ∪ Heart) != P(Black) + P(Heart) + P(Black ∩ Heart)
5. The likely location of a mobile device in a house is as follows - adult Bed room -> 0.03 ,  Child Bed room -> 0.15 , Other Bed room -> 0.14 , Office -> 0.40 , Other Rooms -> 0.28.
   + What is the probability that the device is in the bed room ->  (0.03 + 0.15 + 0.14) = 0.32
   + What is the probability that the device is not in the bed room -> 1 - 0.32 -> 0.68
   + Suppose a household is selected at random with mobile device. what is the room will you expect to find the mobile device -> Office as it has the higest probability of all other options.
** Question 2
A random sample of 200 adult are classfied by their gender and there level of ediction attained.
|------------+------+--------|
| Education  | Male | Female |
|------------+------+--------|
| Elementary |   38 |     45 |
| Secondary  |   28 |     50 |
| College    |   22 |     17 |
|------------+------+--------|
+ If a person is picked at random from this group . What is the probability that person is male given that the person has secondary eduction?
  -> 28/78
+ The person does not have a college degree given that the person is a female.
  -> 95/161
** Question 3
A box contains 500 envelops of which 50 contain 100 Ruppees in cash , 150 contains 25 Ruppees is cash , 300 contains 10 Ruppees in cash. A envelop can be purchased for 25 Ruppees.
+ What is the probability that the first envelop purchased contains less than 100 Ruppees?
  => 450/500
** Question 4
In a certain region of a country it is known from past expience that the probability of selecting a adult over 40 years of age with cancer is 0.05 . If the probability of a doctor correctly diagnosea person with cancer
with having the disease if 0.78 and the probability of incorrctly diagnosaing a person without cancer as having the disease 0.06.
+ What is the probability that an adult over 40 years of age is diagnosed as having cancer?
  P(A) -> event that the adult has cancer = 0.05
  P(A') { adult being without cancer } = 0.95
  P(B) -> Person is diagnosed with cancer = 0.78
  p(B | A) = 0.78 { Person with cancer is diagnosed correctly with cancer } = P(B ∩ A) / P(A) = 0.78 -> P(B ∩ A) = 0.78 * 0.05
  p(B | A') = 0.06 { Person with cancer is diagnosed correctly with cancer } = P(B ∩ A') / P(A') = 0.06 -> P(B ∩ A') = 0.06 * 0.95
  P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A') = 0.78 * 0.05 + 0.06 * 0.95
+ What is the probability that a person diagnosed as having cancer actually have the disease?   {Random Variables}
  P( A | B ) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) = ( P(A) * P(B | A) )/( P(B) ) = (0.05 * 0.78)/(0.75 * 0.05 + 0.06 * 0.95)
** Question 5
Classify the following random variables as discrete or continous?
+ X: No. of accidents per year on a express way -> Discrete
+ Y: length of time to play 18 holes of golf -> continous
+ M: the amount of milk produced by a cow yearly -> continous
+ N: No of eggs made by hen each month -> Discrete
+ P: No of building permits issued each month in a city -> Discrete
+ Q: Weight of grain produced per ache -> continous
** Question 6

_Coins_  _W_
HHH -> 3
HHT -> 1
HTH -> 1
THH -> 1
HTT -> -1
TTH -> -1
THT -> -1
TTT -> -3
** Question 7
Determine the value of 'c' for the following function so that they can be considered as a probability distributions of a discrete random variable.
=NOTE:  Comb (3 | x) = {3}^C_{x}=
a) f(x) = c(x^{2}+4), x = 0,1,2
   f(x) >= 0
   Σ f(x) = 1 = c(4) + c(5) + c(8), c = 1/17
b) f(x) = c * Comb ( 3 | x ) * Comb ( 3 | 3-x ) = 1
          c * ((Comb ( 3 | 0 ) * Comb ( 3 | 3 )) * (Comb ( 3 | 1 ) * Comb ( 3 | 2 )) * (Comb ( 3 | 2 ) * Comb ( 3 | 1 )))
          c * (1 + 9 + 9) = 1
          c = 1/19
** Question 8
Total number of hours in units of hundred hours that a family runs a vaccum cleaner over a period of
one year is a continous random variable X. That has the density function
f(x) = {0 , ∀ 0 < x < 1}
f(x) = {2-x , ∀ 1 <= x < 2}
f(x) = {0 , elsewhere}
find the proability that over the period of one year the family runs there vaccum cleaner
=NOTE: \int ( -\infty | \infty ) ( f(x)dx ) = {-\infty}_\int^{\infty}= (f(x)dx)
=NOTE:  f(x) ( -1 | 1 ) = f(-1) - f(1)=
a) less than 120 hours
   \int ( - \infty | 1.2 ) (f(x)dx) = \int ( - \infty | 0 ) (f(x)dx) + \int ( 0 | 1 ) (f(x)dx) + \int ( 1 | 1.2 ) (f(x)dx)
                            = 0 + \int ( 0 | 1 ) (xdx) + \int ( 0 | 1 ) ((2-x)dx)
                            = \int ( 0 | 1 ) (xdx) + \int ( 0 | 1 ) ((2-x)dx)
                            = ( x^{2}/2 ) (1 | 0)

Here the random variable is discrete
F(x) = P(X <= x) = Σ P(X<=x) (t<=x)

F(x) = 0      ( ∀ x <= 0 )
F(x) = 0.41   ( ∀ 0 <= x <= 1 )
F(x) = 0.78   ( ∀ 1 <= x <= 2 )
F(x) = 0.91   ( ∀ 2 <= x <= 3 )
F(x) = 0.99   ( ∀ 3 <= x <= 4 )
F(x) = 1  ( ∀ x >= 4 )
** Question 10
Consider the density function
\begin{equation}
f(x) = ( 2\sqrt{x} ( ∀ 0<x<1 ) | 0 , elsewhere)
\end{equation}
(i) Evaluate k.
 \int ( - \infty | \infty )f(x)dx = 1 = \int ( 0 | 1 ) ( k x^{1/2} dx)
                         = k * ((x^{3/2})/(3/2)) ( 1 | 0 )
                         = (2k)/3 = 1
                         =k = 1.5=

(ii) Find F(x) and use it P(0.3 < X < 0.6)
F(x) = \int ( - \infty | x ) (f(t)dt) = \int ( 0 | x ) ( 3/2 t^{1/2} dt )
                              = 3/2 ((t^{3/2})/(3/2)) ( 0 | x )

F(x) = 0 (∀ x < 0)
F(x) = x^{3/2}  (∀ 0 <= x < 1)
F(x) = 1 (∀ x >= 1)

P(a <= X <= b) = F(b) - F(a)
P(0.3 < X < 0.6) = F(0.6) - F(0.3) = (0.6)^{3/2} - (0.3)^{3/2}
